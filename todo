* adaptive protocol - adjust replicas as needed. 
* lifetime and radius for data items
* digests, subscriptions
* LMS with radius-constrained storage
* shared key space? (ie tags not keys) - LMS is designed around unique keys,
  but for our purposes the keys are what we query on. 
* model LMS over different topology densities and node congestion
* key-space collisions
